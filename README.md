# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

Using `MongoDB` and `Express` for this challenge, we will be able to create and interact with a `noSQL` database. 

The database is suited for a social media applications that are able to store users, posts (thoughts) among users.

Other users can also post reactions to thoughts. Add or remove Friends & Reactions too!

## Usage

With the Insomnia app we will be able to interact with the database using:

* Get All, GET One by id, POST (CREATE), PUT (UPDATE), DELETE 

* Create or Remove Friends & Reactions
